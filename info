REINFORCE algorithm:

Q: what did i understand ?
create a policy network
which outputs actions
use the policy to act in the environment
and collect a trajectory
increase the probability of actions which produce higher reward

Q: how to do so ?
i need to calculate policy gradient
associate every action taken with its importance/impact/significance
sum over the complete trajectory
update the policy network using the policy gradient
